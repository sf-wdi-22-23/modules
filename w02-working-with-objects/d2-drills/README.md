# Week 2

## Tuesday Lab: JS built-in Objects: Math, Date, etc.

This morning's drills will take you through a series of exercises. You will be provided
a series of JavaScript files, each of which has new activities that build on what
you did in the last one. The files are located in the solutions directory.

Start at the beginning (`index.html` and `script-step-1.js`) and go from there as you get each piece of the project working. Each script file will have detailed instructions about how to proceed through the exercise.

If you get stuck, ask for help, or move on to the next step. The focus is on understanding what is happening, not on intuiting everything at first glance.

**Note: **

*You will need to edit the script tag in your HTML file to match the JavaScript
file of the section you are currently working on as you progress through the drill.*

### Questions to consider:

Why can you create new Date, Array and String objects but not a Math object?
