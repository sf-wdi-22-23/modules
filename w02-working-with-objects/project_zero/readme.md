## Summary

Imagine you want to let people write really short public blog posts. The homepage of your microblog app should be a list of these micro-posts with a form to add a new one. We don't have a backend yet, so we won't be worrying about login, users, followers, and all of that good stuff quite yet. But we can create new blog posts, have them added to the page!

Something like this:

## Basic Requirements

| Concepts | Tools |
| :------: | :---: | :-----: |
| User Stories, OOP | Bootstrap, jQuery, Git, Kanban Board |

1. Make your basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story">user narrative</a>, <a href="http://www.re-vision.com/webwork/p27wireframes/drawing_small.jpg">wireframe</a>, and Kanban board. These are required!
2. Start by cloning the [basic template](https://github.com/sf-wdi-22-23/blank_template) and renaming the folder to micro-blog. CD into micro-blog and than run 'git remote rm origin'. This will remove the connection between this git repo and the basic-template Github repo. Create a new public repo on your github, and DO NOT create the readme. Follow the instructions to push an existing repository from the command line, connecting your micro-blog to a new Github repo you own.

3. Make frequent commits and pushes (every hour or so). You should commit every time you add a new feature, and it is working! A feature can be something as small as adding a little style. Add a very short README.md that outlines what your app does and the libraries you are using.
3. Use default Bootstrap classes with minimal custom CSS.
4. Make a list of `posts` using HTML strings, JavaScript and jQuery (and Object Oriented Programming!) that render to the DOM.
5. Make a form to add new `posts` to the list using jQuery.
6. Be sure to comment your code, and make the code clean (mind spacing and indentation).

## Stretch Challenges (optional)

* Add a count of how many posts have been posted that updates every time a new post is created.
* Add a Bootstrap JS component like a tooltip.
* Add more custom CSS to make it very beautiful :)
* Add `Model` object that saves `posts` to `localStorage`. A Model is an object that handles persistent data.
* Add `comments` on `posts`.
* These get tricky, but you DO have a long weekend. :)

* [The Solution](https://github.com/sf-wdi-22-23/Project-0-Solution/tree/master) lives here. "Wait until you have a hole in your brain the shape of the answer, before you look at the answer." Optimize for your own learning, NOT for "getting an A" that doesn't exist. 

## Submit by Tuesday Morning 9:09am

Push your project to a public repo, and share the link using this Google Form: http://goo.gl/forms/NNBMwSJ2XW
Please include:

1.  a link to the github repository for the project
2.  a link to a picture of your kanban board or it's online location (e.g. public trello link)
3.  a link to the wireframe (image) you drew for your site design
4.  and a direct link to your user stories (possibly in your project repo).

### Need more to do?
1. Check out [this excellent talk](https://vimeo.com/105955605) in which Mary Rose Cook live codes Space Invaders from scratch in 30 minutes. She's using HTML Canvas, which is a HTML5 element that is cool. Don't worry about understanding it all, just watch in awe and appreciation, and follow along as best you can. 
2. Check out [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html), particularly Chapter 6, on Objects. The earlier chapters can be great for review as well.
