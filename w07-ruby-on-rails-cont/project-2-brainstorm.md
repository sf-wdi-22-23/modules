# PROJECT 2 BRAINSTORM

## This weekend in addition to continuing to work on Vagabond, spend some time brainstorming ideas for project 2!

	Please write down 5 ideas, with a sentence or two about each and submit them via the usual method.

# Pitches

## On Tuesday after you present your Vagabond projects, any students that wish to will have the opportunity to pitch 1 or more ideas to the group.

This will be great practice for you to pitch ideas. It also will give us the opportunity to form your groups around your cohorts most exciting and creative ideas. Don't be shy! The more people pitching the better.

After pitches your cohort will have opportunity to vote on their favorite ideas. Instructors will have veto power if they feel the idea is too large or small in scope, or too divergent from the course expectations.

Once we have 5 ideas, students will submit their top three preferences for which idea they want to work on. We will do our best to put you on the team with your first or second choice.


Have a great weekend!
