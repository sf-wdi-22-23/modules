a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.

## What is MongoDB?
### MongoDB is a NoSQL database.
 - NoSQL is a class of database management systems (DBMS) that do not follow all of the rules of a relational DBMS and cannot use traditional SQL to query data.
 - It stores data in a database using nested documents and objects, rather than the rows and columns of a traditional database

## Express with MongoDB

### You can use Express with MongoDB without Mongoose. But it is not nice. 

Lines of code to connect to MongoDB WITHOUT Mongoose: 11
Lines of code to connect to MongoDB WITH Mongoose:    2

## What is an ODM?
An ODM (Object-Document Mapper) is a tool that lets you query and manipulate data from a non-relational database using an object paradigm.

Kind of like a librarian that knows a bunch of things, so you don't have to.
Similar to jQuery, Mongoose provides an adds a number of helper methods. Where jQuery adds methods for interacting with the DOM, Mongoose adds methods for interacting with a Mongo Database. 

## Exercises:
### Building an ODM!


Yesterday we whiteboarded a `where()` function similar to Mongoose's `where()`. Today we are going to work on building a Model class that has a `where()` function, as well as a few more.
