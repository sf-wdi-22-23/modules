# validIP?

Write a method that takes a string as input. It should return true if
the input is a valid IPv4 address (ie. anything between `0.0.0.0` and
`255.255.255.255` is valid).

Run `rspec` in this directory to see failing tests. If you do not have `rspec` run `gem install rspec` and try it again. Once you see failing tests write code in the `ip_address_validator.rb` file to make them pass. Feel free to checkout `/spec/ip_address_validator_spec.rb` to see the sample tests that have been written.

Make sure your code is
* DRY
* Named semantically
* Small
