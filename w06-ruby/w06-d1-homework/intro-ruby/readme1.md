| ... apply methods in ruby to solve problems |


## Intro to the week

Before we move into ruby it's important to revisit how we learned our first language and use that to organize our study of our new language. Learning our second programming language is a process of translating expressions, patterns, and concepts from our familiar language into our new langauge. However, learning our first language involved more identification and comprehension of knowledge required to implement our first programs. We should really begin by organizing this knowledge to build a better understanding before we transition.

## Think-Pair-Share
* What is javascript? What does it look like?
* What were some of the primitives in javascript? (Syntactic things. Think things like variable declaration, conditionals, functions, etc)
* How did we use javascript to build things? What sort of ways did we build up from the fundementals of the language?
* What could possibly be different in another language? How could we change the syntax, but keep the semantics?

### Types of Knowledge

* Imperative knowledge
> your "how to" knowledge, i.e. describing how to do something
* Declarative knowledge
> your "what is" knowledge. i.e. describing what something is.

### Parts of A Language

* `Primitives`
* `Combinations`
* `Abstractions`


### Ruby vs. JS Primitives

Let's recall some of our JS Data Types


#### Javascript

* `null`, `undefined`
* Strings
* Booleans
* Number
  * `.toString`
* Arrays
  `indexOf`,`splice`, `slice`
* Objects
  * `["some_key"]`, `.some_key`
* operators
  * `==`, `===`, `>`, `>=`, ..
  * `!`, `||`, `&&`
  * `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`
* Console methods
    * `console.log`
    * `prompt`

#### Ruby

* `nil`
* Integers
    * Fixnum
    * Bignum
     * `to_s`
* Floats
* Strings
  * `.to_i` and `.to_f` `*INTEGER`
* Symbols
* Ranges
* Booleans
* Arrays
  * `[x..y]`, `[x...y]`, `index`
* Hashes
  * `{ :key => value }`
  * `{ key: value }` which is the same as `{:key =>value }`
  * `[some_key]` and `[some_key]=`
  * `key`,`.keys`, `.each`
* operators
  * `||=`, `*=`, `/=`
  * `==`, `.equal?`,
  * `!`, `not`, `||`, `&&`
  * `**`, `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`
* General Delimited Input
    * `%w`, `%r`
* Console Methods
    * `puts`, `p`
    * `gets` and `gets.chomp`

### Control flow


#### Javascript ([Some Control Flow Structures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Statements))

* Conditionals
    * `if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`, ...
* Loops
    * `do-while`, `while`,  ...
* iterators,
    * `for-in`
* Exceptions
    * `try`, `catch`

#### Ruby ([Some Control Flow Structures](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/Syntax/Control_Structures))

* Conditionals
    * `if`, `elsif`, `else`, `unless`, `case when else` ...
* Loops
    * `until`, `while`, `times` ...
* iterators,
    * `.each`, `for ... in`
* Exceptions
    *  `begin`, `rescue`, `ensure`


### Some Abstractions

#### Javascript

* Function
    * Anonymous: `function (param1, [..param2, [...]]){...}`,
    * Named: `function Name(param1, [..param2, [...]]){...}`
    * Uses lexical scope
    * Used as values
    * require explicit return
    * all `params` are optional

#### Ruby   

 * Function
    * uses `def`
    * Do not capture scope
    * Not used as values
    * optional parameters must be specified
    * implicitly returns last evaluation

* block
    * used with `.each`, `.map`, et cetera

    ```
    some_method do |param1, [param2, [...]]
        # some code
    end

    ```
    * captures scope

#Intro to Ruby

#### Define a method

```ruby
def say_hello
  puts "Hello"
end

say_hello
```

#### Define a method with a parameter

```ruby
def say(something)
  puts something
end

say('hello')
say 'gello'
```

#### Define a method that operates on two parameters
```ruby
def add_numbers(first, second)
  puts first + second
end

add_numbers(1,2)
add_numbers 1, 2
```

#### Printing and returning are different
```ruby
def add_numbers_quietly(first, second)
  first + second
end

add_numbers_quietly(1,2)
add_numbers_quietly 1, 2
```

#### Methods in Ruby always return the value of the last evaluated expression
```ruby
def implicitly_return_5
  if true
    5
  end
end

implicitly_return_5
```

* What was the value of the if statement?
* `status_of_world = if 1 == 2 then "messed up" else "a-o-k" end`
* `result = 1 == 2 ? "wuh oh" : "phew"`

#### Parameters can have default values

```ruby
def say(something = "Hello")
  puts something
end

say # prints "Hello"
say "Goodbye" # prints "Goodbye"
```
#### Recursion: methods can call themselves

```ruby
def recurse(depth)
  if depth > 0
    puts "Spiraling down..."
    recurse(depth - 1)
    puts "Spiraling up..."
  else
    puts "Bottom of the rabbit hole"
  end
end

recurse(5)
recurse 5
```

## The biggest difference from javascript

#### Functions have locally scoped variables
The following code wont work. Why?
```ruby
foo = 1

def do_stuff
  foo += 1
  bar = 1
  puts foo
  puts bar
end

do_stuff

puts foo
puts bar
```

The problem is the ruby is locally scoped. Meaning that a function only has access to its variables and the variables it defined inside of itself.

```ruby
foo = 1

def do_stuff
  foo = 1
  foo += 1
  bar = 1
  puts foo
  puts bar
end

do_stuff

puts foo
puts bar

def do_stuff2(x)
  foo = x
  foo += 1
  bar = 1
  puts foo
  puts bar
end

puts do_stuff2(foo)
```
## Exercises

You may create a separate file for each of the exercises to avoid cluttering a file.

### Looping And Other Exercises

Use a loop to do  the following:

1.) Write a method called `p_times` that takes a `statement` and a `num` puts the `statement` some `num` of times to the console.

2.) Write a method called `letter_count` to count letter occurence in a string, returned as a `Hash`.

3.) Write a method called `mock_me` that `gets` some input from the terminal and puts it until the input is the word `quit` or `q`. (Be sure to remove trailing `\n`.)

4.) Write a method called `print_contacts` that takes a `hash` of `name` and `phone-number` key-value pairs and puts the `name` with the contact info.

5.) Write a method called `get_contact` that

* takes a `contacts` hash,
* prints the contacts,
* prompts the terminal for a **new** `name` and a `phone` number,
* and then adds the `name` and `phone` as a key value pair respectively if `name` is not already a contact.
* The `get_contact` method should `return` the `contacts` hash.

### List exercises

#### Using `Array#inject`

Write a method for each exercise below that uses `Array#inject`:

1.) Write a method called `get_sum` to find the `sum` of the values in an array.

2.) Write a method called `get_max` to find the `max` of the values in an array.

3.) Write a method called `get_min` to find the `min` of the values in an array.

4.) Write a method called `reverse_str` to reverse a string.

**Challenge**: *write a method called `partial_sums` that pushes the partial sum of an array to a new list*

```
partial_sums([])
#=> [0]
partial_sums([5])
#=> [0, 5]
partial_sums([5,6,7])
#=> [0, 5, 11, 18]
```

#### Using `Array#map`

Write a method for each exercise below that uses `Array#map`:

1.)  Write a method called `multiply_by` that takes a number and returns an array of numbers multiplied by that number.

2.)  Write a method called `reverse_each` that takes an array of words and returns an array of reversed words.

3.)  Write method called `get_responses` that takes an array of questions (strings) and returns an array of responses input from the console for each question. (Hint: you will need to use `gets.chomp` and `puts` )

### Method Problems

* Write a method to compute the `factorial` of a number.
* Write a method to check if a number is a `palindrome`.
* Write a method to `reverse` a word in-place, do not use iterators, use only a while loop and indices.
* Write a method to `merge` to two sorted Arrays.
