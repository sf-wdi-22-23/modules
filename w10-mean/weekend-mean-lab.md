# MEAN Weekend Lab

So we've been learning the MEAN stack piece by piece, now its time to put things all together.

## The Goal

The goal of this project is to build a 2 resource MEAN app without authentication. Besides that it is pretty much up to you what you build. Here are some suggestions:

* A Stack Overflow Clone - A Question and Answer platform
* A Microblog with Comments
* A "Yelp of" - Create reviews about anything - yoga studios, online stores, baby toys, you name it.

## Some Patterns

So you you want to build a two resource app in MEAN stack - first thing's first - **MAKE A PLAN**.

Where should you start? Start with a seed project - probably one of the ones we started with in class.

Ok you've got your seed project cloned and bower installed and nodemon-ed. Eggcellent! What next?

Some things to think about:

* Write user narratives, draw wireframes, and draw a schema diagram. (There are no projects too small to do these crucial steps of software development).
* Work outside in starting with an angular route template and controller.
* Make a step-by-step plan for what you are going to work on. Make a sub-plan for each step with the steps you'll take to do that.
* Use Angular to do stuff (not jQuery).
* Try mocking your data in your angular app before connecting to your server. You can prototype an angular app and then connect it to its server via `$http` or `$resource`.
* Use services with `$resource` to make easy access to your restful routes.
* Review mongoose and express docs to make your models and associate them.
* Follow convention over configuration. Check and see if there is a convention, an npm module, or a directive out there to do what you want to do.

## Stretch Challenges

If you finish your 2 resource CRUD app add another feature. Perhaps review the [ui-bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/) directives and add one. (no accordians) :P Or add some css animations with `ng-class`.
