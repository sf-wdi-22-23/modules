#Lightning Talks

Your goal is to create a 5-6 minute presentation on a topic that is useful to your fellow developer. We encourage you to dive right in with a small demo that you created! Please also create a brief readme outlining your findings and any helpful resources you discover in your research.

- What problem does this technology solve?
- How do you use it? Is there a "cheatsheet" you found or made that others can reference?
- What did you build?

Lightning talks will be on Wednesday morning next week, December 9th.
