# Responsive Web Design

If you want your portfolio to look great across various devices, you should invest some time learning about responsive web design. If you plan to apply for front-end web development jobs, you *must* know basic principles of responsive design.  

Tonight's homework is intended to be light enough that you can review new Angular material from the past few days, while still preparing  to move forward with Angular and with even more awesome UIs for your sites.


1. Flip through the Google Developer's fundamentals guide <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/?hl=en" target="_blank">Design and UI</a> section.

2. Read the Google Developer's fundamentals guide on <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/responsive/fundamentals/?hl=en" target="_blank">Responsive Web Design basics</a>, including the four short articles listed under the Topics heading on that page.  

	**How have we been making our websites responsive so far?**

3. The labs we've seen the past few days have been using Boostrap with Angular. As you know, jQuery is required for many Bootstrap components. But you also know jQuery and Angular shouldn't be used together because they interact with the DOM in different ways. 

	**How have we been "getting away with" using Bootstrap with Angular?** (You can check out <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-22-23/angular-custom-directives/blob/master/solution-code/app/index.html" target="_blank">the Cards Against Assembly index.html</a> for an example.)

4. Check out <a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/getting_started" target="_blank">UI-Bootstrap</a>.  What is it for? Read over the buttons section.  


5. Review angular! Here are just a few of the resources your classmates recommend:
