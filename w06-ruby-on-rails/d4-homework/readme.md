## Rails for Zombies

Rails for Zombies is a fun tutorial that introduces Ruby on Rails with a weird theme song and macabre sense of humor.

There are 5 levels, as follows:
* CRUD
* Models
* Views
* Controllers
* Routes

Each level begins with an introductory video over 10 minutes each, but if you understand the reading from Wednesday, it may not be necessary to watch them. The most time-consuming approach is to watch the video and then scrub through as you try to answer each challenge. Instead, all of the solutions can be inferred from [this PDF](docs/Rails-For-Zombies-Slides.pdf). Enjoy the videos if you want, but use the PDF as review as you work through each challenge.

#### SUBMIT 
Please copy and paste each command into a file `YOURNAME-zombies.rb` and submit by Friday morning drills. As always, go ahead and submit the homework even if you are unable to complete all five levels. (This gives us great information about what we teach and how much homework we assign.) You may continue working on this over the weekend and re-submit on Monday, if you like.
